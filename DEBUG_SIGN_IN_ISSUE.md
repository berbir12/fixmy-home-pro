# 🔍 Debugging Sign-In Issue

## Problem
The sign-in button does nothing when clicked.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. **Check Browser Console**
Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and look for these logs:

**Expected logs when clicking sign-in:**
```
🔗 Auth component: Attempting login with: { email: "your-email@example.com" }
🔗 Login mutation called with: { email: "your-email@example.com" }
🔗 SupabaseApiClient login called with: { email: "your-email@example.com" }
🔗 Login success response: { success: true, data: {...} }
```

**If you see errors:**
- `❌ Missing Supabase environment variables!` - Environment variables not set
- `🔗 Login error: ...` - Authentication failed
- `🔗 Login failed: ...` - API response error

### 2. **Check Environment Variables**
In your browser console, you should see:
```
🔗 API Client: Using SupabaseApiClient
🔗 Supabase URL: Configured
🔗 Supabase Anon Key: Configured
```

If you see "Not configured" or "Missing", your environment variables aren't set.

### 3. **Test with Known User**
Try logging in with a user that definitely exists in your Supabase database:

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Authentication → Users**
3. **Find a user or create a test user**
4. **Try logging in with those credentials**

### 4. **Check Supabase Settings**
Make sure your Supabase project is properly configured:

1. **Email confirmation disabled** (for development)
2. **Site URL configured** in Authentication settings
3. **RLS policies** allow login

### 5. **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### Issue: "Missing Supabase environment variables"
**Solution:**
- Check your Vercel environment variables
- Make sure `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
- Redeploy if needed

#### Issue: "Login failed" or "Invalid email or password"
**Solution:**
- User doesn't exist in Supabase
- Password is incorrect
- Email confirmation is required (disable for development)

#### Issue: No console logs at all
**Solution:**
- Check if the button click is being registered
- Verify the form validation is passing
- Check for JavaScript errors

### 6. **Quick Test**
Try this in your browser console:
```javascript
// Test if Supabase is configured
console.log('VITE_SUPABASE_URL:', import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL);
console.log('VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY:', import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);

// Test if the API client is working
window.api = window.api || {};
```

### 7. **Expected Behavior**
When sign-in works correctly:
1. ✅ Console shows login attempt logs
2. ✅ User is redirected to `/dashboard`
3. ✅ User data is loaded
4. ✅ No error toasts appear

### 8. **Next Steps**
1. **Check the console logs** when you click sign-in
2. **Share the console output** if you see errors
3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
4. **Test with a known user** from your Supabase database

The debugging logs will help identify exactly where the issue is occurring!
