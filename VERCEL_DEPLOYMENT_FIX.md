# Vercel Deployment Fix for Admin Route

## Issue
The `/admin` route is returning a 404 error on Vercel deployment. This happens because Vercel doesn't know how to handle client-side routes in Single Page Applications (SPAs).

## Solution
I've added two configuration files to fix this:

### 1. `vercel.json` (Root Directory)
This file tells Vercel to redirect all routes to `index.html`, allowing React Router to handle the routing:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
          "value": "1; mode=block"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. `public/_redirects` (Public Directory)
This is a backup solution that also redirects all routes to `index.html`:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## Steps to Fix

1. **Commit and push the new files:**
   ```bash
   git add vercel.json public/_redirects
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel routing for SPA"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Find your project
   - Click "Redeploy" or wait for automatic deployment
   - Or trigger a new deployment by pushing to your main branch

3. **Test the fix:**
   - Visit `https://fixmy-home-pro.vercel.app/admin`
   - Should now load the admin dashboard instead of 404

## Alternative Solutions

If the above doesn't work, you can also:

1. **Use Vercel's built-in SPA support:**
   - In your Vercel dashboard, go to Settings → General
   - Enable "Automatically expose System Environment Variables"
   - Add a build command that includes SPA configuration

2. **Check Vercel deployment settings:**
   - Ensure "Framework Preset" is set to "Vite"
   - Build Command should be: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory should be: `dist`

## Verification

After deployment, test these routes:
- ✅ `/` - Home page
- ✅ `/admin` - Admin dashboard (should work now)
- ✅ `/dashboard` - User dashboard
- ✅ `/services` - Services page
- ✅ Any other client-side routes

The admin dashboard should now be accessible at `https://fixmy-home-pro.vercel.app/admin` for users with admin role.
